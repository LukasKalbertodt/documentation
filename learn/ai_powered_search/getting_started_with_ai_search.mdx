# Getting started with AI-powered search <NoticeTag type="experimental" label="experimental" />

[AI-powered search](https://meilisearch.com/solutions/vector-search), sometimes also called vector search or hybrid search, is an experimental technology that uses [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to retrieve search results based on the meaning and context of a query.

This tutorial will walk you through configuring AI-powered search in your Meilisearch project. You will see how to activate this feature, generate document embeddings with OpenAI, and perform your first search.

## Requirements

- A running Meilisearch project
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- A command-line console

## Create a new index

First, create a new Meilisearch project. If you need a refresher or if this is your first time using Meilisearch, follow the [getting started](/learn/getting_started/cloud_quick_start).

Next, create a `kitchenware` index and add [this kitchenware products dataset](/assets/datasets/kitchenware.json) to it. It will take Meilisearch a few moments to process the data.

## Activate AI-powered search

AI-powered search is an experimental feature and is disabled by default. You must manually activate it either via the Meilisearch Cloud UI, or with the experimental features endpoint.

To use AI-powered search with Meilisearch Cloud, you must first enter the waitlist. You will not be able to activate vector search until your sign-up has been approved.

### Meilisearch Cloud UI

Navigate to your project overview and find "Experimental features". Then click on the "AI-powered search" box.

![A section of the project overview interface titled "Experimental features". The image shows a few options, including "Vector store".](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meilisearch/documentation/main/assets/images/vector-search/01-cloud-vector-store.png)

### Experimental features endpoint

Use [the `/experimental-features` route](/reference/api/experimental_features) to activate vector search during runtime:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/experimental-features/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
  --data-binary '{
    "vectorStore": true
  }'
```

## Generate vector embeddings with OpenAI

Next, you must generate vector embeddings for all documents in your dataset. Embeddings are mathematical representations of the meanings of words and sentences in your documents. Meilisearch relies on various external providers to generate these embeddings.

For this tutorial, you should use OpenAI. Log into OpenAI, or create an account if this is your first time using it. Generate a new API key using [OpenAI's web interface](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

After copying the key value, open your terminal and send the following request to create a new embedder:

```sh
curl \
  -X PATCH 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/kitchenware/settings' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "embedders": {
      "openai": {
        "source":  "openAi",
        "apiKey": "OPEN_AI_API_KEY",
        "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "documentTemplate": "An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Replace `localhost:7700` with the address of your Meilisearch project, and `OPEN_AI_API_KEY` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

Meilisearch and OpenAI will start processing your documents and updating your index. This process may take a few moments, but once it's done you are ready to perform an AI-powered search.

<Capsule intent="tip">
You may use any key tier for this tutorial, but prefer [Tier 2 keys](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-two) for optimal performance in production environments.
</Capsule>

### `documentTemplate`

`documentTemplate` describes a short [Liquid template](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/). The text inside curly brackets (`{{`) indicates a document field in dot notation, where `doc` indicates the document itself and the string that comes after the dot indicates a document attribute. Meilisearch replaces these brackets and their contents with the corresponding field value.

The resulting text is the prompt OpenAI uses to generate document embeddings.

For example, kitchenware documents have three fields: `id`, `name`, and `price`. If your `documentTemplate` is `"An object used in a kitchen named '{{doc.name}}'"`, the text Meilisearch will send to the embedder when indexing the first document is `"An object used in a kitchen named 'Wooden spoon'"`.

Keep your templates short and only include highly relevant information. This ensures optimal indexing performance and search result relevancy.

## Perform an AI-powered search

As you may have seen in the getting started, to perform basic text searches in Meilisearch you must send a request to the `/search` endpoint. This request usually specifies a `q` parameter, which contains the words you are looking for.

AI-powered searches are very similar to those basic text searches. You must query the `/search` endpoint with a request containing both `q` and `hybrid`. For this tutorial, `hybrid` is an object with a single `embedder` field:

```sh
curl \
  -X POST 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/kitchenware/search' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '{
    "q": "kitchen utensils made of wood",
    "hybrid": {
      "embedder": "openai"
    }
  }'
```

Meilisearch will return an equal mix of semantic and full-text matches.

## Conclusion

Congratulations. You have created an index, added a small dataset to it, and activated AI-powered search. You then used OpenAI to generate embeddings out of your documents, and performed your first AI-powered search.

## Next steps

Now you have a basic overview of the basic steps required for setting up and performing AI-powered searches, you might want to try and implement this feature in your own application.

For practical information on implementing AI-powered search with other services, consult our [guides section](/guides/ai/openai). There you will find specific instructions for embedders such as [LangChain](/guides/ai/langchain) and [Cloudflare](/guides/ai/cloudflare).

For more in-depth information, consult the API reference for [embedder settings](/reference/api/settings#embedders-experimental) and [the `hybrid` search parameter](/reference/api/search#hybrid-search-experimental).
